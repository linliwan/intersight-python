# A learning case for getting started with Cisco Intersight REST API and SDK.

Because the official Python SDK has a relatively comprehensive package, especially in terms of authentication, it is difficult for beginners to understand its principles, so I have specially written some cases to help users understand its authentication mechanism.
In addition, I also designed some basic cases to help users quickly get started with Python SDK.

Before executing these test scripts, you need to 
 - Set and load the environment variables in .envrc, refer to .envrc.example.
 - If you are using Linux or MacOS, you can install direnv to load these environment variables; 
 - If you are using Windows, you can try to use dotenv for instead.

The example folder contains examples about how to quickly get started with Intersight Python SDK; 
The tools folder contains some script tools for UCS.
